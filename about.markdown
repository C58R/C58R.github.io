	<h2 class="About-title scroll-reveal">About Me</h2>
	<p class="scroll-reveal">
		At 24, I was responsible for leading a team of fellow Marines while protecting U.S. diplomats, safeguarding classified materials, overseeing daily security operations, and coordinating with host nation officials to maintain safety and operational readiness. My assignments in Liberia, Taiwan, and the Czech Republic each introduced new teams, cultures, and challenges, consistently testing my leadership, logistical skills, and adaptability in high-stakes environments.
	</p>
	<p class="scroll-reveal">
		I served as Assistant Detachment Commander and, during periods of leadership turnover, stepped in as Acting Detachment Commander. In this role, I led a detachment of six Marines—some older and some younger than me—without an immediate supervisor. That responsibility forced me to understand the broader picture of embassy security and decision-making. I worked closely with embassy personnel, represented the Marines in high-level meetings, and made decisions that directly impacted the safety of diplomats and classified materials. These experiences taught me that effective leadership is not rigid; it is built on trust, communication, and adaptability.
	</p>
	<p class="scroll-reveal">
		Alongside my professional responsibilities, I immersed myself in the cultures of the countries where I served. In Liberia, I witnessed extreme underdevelopment alongside remarkable resilience and hospitality, which reshaped how I value perspective and gratitude. In Taiwan, I experienced a culture deeply rooted in tradition and community, where food serves as a powerful connector. In the Czech Republic, I encountered a slower, more intentional way of life that emphasized balance and community. Each assignment broadened my worldview and strengthened my sense of empathy and cultural awareness.
	</p>
	<p class="scroll-reveal">
		These experiences continue to shape how I approach challenges today. The discipline, independence, and leadership I developed in the Marine Corps guide how I learn, collaborate, and problem-solve. I bring a global perspective, resilience, and curiosity into my work, and I strive to contribute thoughtfully to the teams and communities I am part of.
